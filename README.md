# Thesis_Codes
This repo contains (some) codes for the back-calculation models discussed in the thesis "Estimating HIV incidence from multiple sources of data" by Francesco Brizzi (University of Cambridge)


"AI" denotes age-independent back-calculation models. These are of four types: RW (random walk), GP (Gaussian Process) and spl (splines)
