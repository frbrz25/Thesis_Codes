# Thesis_Codes
This repo contains (some) codes for the back-calculation models discussed in the thesis "Estimating HIV incidence from multiple sources of data" by Francesco Brizzi (University of Cambridge)


"AI" denotes age-independent back-calculation models. These are of four types: RW1 (random walk from an intermediate point of the epidemic), RW1978 (random walk from the beginning of the epidemic), GP (Gaussian Process) and spl (splines).

"ptens" denotes the age-dependent back-calculation model, using a tensor product spline to model incidence
"tps" denotes the age-dependent back-calculation model, using a thin plate spline to model incidence
